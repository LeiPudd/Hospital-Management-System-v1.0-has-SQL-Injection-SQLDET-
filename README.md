Then enter the corresponding information based on the type. In the "PIN code" field, input an SQL injection scriptï¼Œsuch as
```sql
123456' AND EXTRACTVALUE(1, CONCAT('~', VERSION())) AND '
```
The rest of the information can be fabricated. Click "submit" to retrieve the version of the MySQL server.

So, we can see that the version of the MySQL server is 8.0.12, which matches the version I tested locally.
